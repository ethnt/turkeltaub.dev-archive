I'm a Brooklyn, NY-based software developer using Elixir, Ruby, and JavaScript to make web products. I've been doing computer-y stuff for ten years, and I'm currently a senior software engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) working on the Web Presence & Platform team. Previously, I was a software engineer at [Enlitic](https://www.enlitic.com/), a software engineer at [Aircall](https://aircall.io), a full-stack developer at [Oak](https://oak.is), and a web developer at [Fanzter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzter).
